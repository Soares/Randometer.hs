This is a little set of games that have helped me gain an intuition for random
behavior. A better knowledge of what random patterns look like has helped me,
in real life, to better differentiate between chance occurrences and actual
patterns.

Humans are [biased to see patterns in random data](http://psych.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/Gilo.Vallone.Tversky.pdf):
these games go a little way towards helping identify and correct for that bias,
by staving off premature pattern matching.
